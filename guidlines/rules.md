• Don't leave a panel on, if left unsupervised, guests will be unable to ride the attraction.

• Don't wear any unrealistic clothing when operating an attraction. This includes accessories that fully cover limbs and hats that are large enough to be a distraction from the experience.

• Don't argue with guests. If a guest is trolling in chat, blocking the operation of a ride, or exploiting; contact an active manager as soon as possible. If no managers are available, contact a supervisor.

• Don't argue with other Cast Members over who is operating on a panel, how they are using their script, or how long they have been operating. Panels are first come, first serve.

• You must be operating the attraction while clocked in, any attempts to exploit the point system will result in immediate suspension and data wipe.

• Cast Members must use grammar at all times while in-game, this includes while talking to other Cast Members.

• Most importantly, have fun while maintaining a professional attitude.
