## Introduction

Soarin' has 7 different panels. Four show panels, one preshow panel and two greeter panels. The show panels consist of the main panel, which you should use if no one is operating the show; and 3 side panels which are the ones you can use if the main panel is already staffed. The 2 greeter panels consist of an entrance panel and a mid queue panel. You can choose to operate any empty panel at any time (with the exception of the side show panels, which as explained above can only be used if the main show panel is in use).
