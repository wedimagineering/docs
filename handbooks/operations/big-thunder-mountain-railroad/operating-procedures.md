In order to get to the panel, you'll have to cross to the side platform. This image shows in a red square the area where you can cross. This area is located just beside the stairs to enter the operator booth. Please don't cross the platform if the train is moving in or out of the station.

When starting a new cycle, first wait for the preshow doors (check indicator \[9]) to open. The next step is playing the safety spiel. If the preshow is being operated manually you can wait until they close the doors or let you know everyone has entered the show area. If the preshow is automatic, wait 15-30 seconds or check when everyone has entered and play the safety spiel. A bit later than halfway through the safety spiel you'll see that the blue lights on the floor will start doing their first sequence. It'll be from that moment where, if the preshow is automatic, the entrance doors will close. Once the safety spiel has finished playing, you can proceed to the next stage. This will differ a bit depending on if the side panels are being manned or not. The first thing to do (which is common in both conditions) is to wait until everyone has sat down (or at least you don't see anyone standing up from the main panel position).

#### Main panel-only operations

When there's only 1 active cast member, meaning there is only 1 panel on, you must use the main panel. If you were previously operating with 2 panels and one of the cast members has to leave, please turn off the side panel and go to the main panel to continue operating from there _(you won't be able to dispatch by only using the side panel)_.

When the train reaches the station, release the restraints so people can get out of the train. Give the guests some seconds to exit. After the guests have left the train, open the gates and play the safety spiel. Wait until the spiel has finished playing _(this includes the Spanish part of the spiel)_ and then, if no one is boarding the train, close the gates. After closing the gates, wait a couple of seconds and once everyone is sitting in their seats, lock the restraints. After locking the restraints, enable the dispatch and dispatch the train _(after you press the enable dispatch, you'll have 5 seconds to press dispatch before you need to enable it again)_.

If a person refuses to sit for a reasonable amount of time and/or is delaying the operations, you can lock the restraints/close the gates, and dispatch the train without them. Please contact a supervisor if the situation escalates.

#### Multiple panel operations

{% hint style="info" %}
Side panels should only be operated if the main panel is being operated.
{% endhint %}

When there are 2 active panels the main panel loses some functions. It won't be able to operate the gates nor will be able to release the restraints.

When the train reaches the station, the side panel operator will release the restraints. Give the guests some seconds to exit. After they have left the train, then the side panel operator will open the gates and the main panel operator will play the safety spiel. Wait until the spiel has finished playing _(this includes the Spanish part of the spiel)_ and then, if no one is boarding the train, the side panel operator will close the gates. After closing the gates, wait a couple of seconds and once everyone is sitting in their seats, the side panel operator will lock the restraints. After this, the lock restraint button on the main panel will start flashing and the main panel operator will press it to lock the restraints. Only after both panels have locked the restraints will the restraints fully lock. Once the restraints are locked, we are able to dispatch the train. To do this we need to follow a specific order of operations. First, the side panel operator will enable the dispatch. This will give the main panel operator 15 seconds to enable and dispatch the train.
