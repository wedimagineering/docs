### Staff Paths

Unlike in previous rides there are no commands to teleport to specific areas such as load, unload. This is due to the small distance to get to the ride station.

When entering the ride, you'll see a gate saying cast members only:

You'll enter through there and once you enter the building just continue straight until you reach a wall, then turn right and you'll find the ramp that takes you to the load station.

### Incident Management

#### Guest refusing to take a seat

If this should happen, and you've repeatedly asked the guest to take a seat and they refuse, then you should try contacting a <mark style="color:blue;">Manager+</mark> (if they're online), and let them know about the issue (it's also important to let them know the user's name). However, since we want to give the rest of the guests the best experience possible, you should not wait until the incident is solved to continue the normal operations and just continue and let the manager+ deal with it.

#### Guest refusing to leave room

If this should happen, and you've repeatedly asked the guest to exit and they refuse, then you should try contacting a <mark style="color:blue;">Manager+</mark> (if they're online), and let them know about the issue (it's also important to let them know the user's name). However, since we want to give the rest of the guests the best experience possible, you should not wait until the incident is solved to continue the normal operations and just continue and let the <mark style="color:blue;">Manager+</mark> deal with it.
