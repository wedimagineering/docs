### Staff Commands

You can use the following commands to teleport you around the game:

* **/stp a**: Teleports you to the greeter panel, specifically outside of the preshow room.
* **/stp p**: Teleports you outside of the pre-show, specifically in the clock room.
* **/stp l**: Teleports you to the load platform, specifically outside of the main panel.&#x20;
* **/stp u**: Teleports you to the unload platform, specifically aside from the panel.&#x20;
* **/stp e**: Teleports you to the exit.

### Staff Paths

#### Load/unload station paths

To walk between the load/unload stations, you can use a corridor that communicates both stations.

#### Queue/preshow paths

There's a hidden path that allows cast members to enter/exit the preshow without having to open the preshow doors. First, you need to go to the entrance of the preshow. Then instead of going through the standard queue path you enter through the other side. Then just continue straight and walk through the <mark style="background-color:blue;">Studio B</mark> door and then just enter the other door you'll find in the room. Then just walk down to the first floor of the preshow by walking through the railing that separates the preshow's second and first floor.

### Incident Management

#### Guest refusing to take a seat

If this should happen, and you've repeatedly asked the guest to take a seat and they refuse, then you should try contacting a <mark style="color:blue;">**manager**</mark><mark style="color:blue;">+</mark> (if they're online), and let them know about the issue (it's also important to let them know the user's name). However, since we want to give the rest of the guests the best experience possible, you should not wait until the incident is solved to continue the normal operations and just continue and let the <mark style="color:blue;">**manager**</mark><mark style="color:blue;">+</mark> deal with it.

#### Guest refusing to leave room
