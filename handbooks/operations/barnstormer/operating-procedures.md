# ðŸ“— Operating Procedures

## Main Panel

When the train reaches the station, you first need to **play the load spiel**. After that you must unlock the restraints. _Please wait until everyone has been teleported out before continuing._ The next step is to open the gates. Now wait until everyone gets in. The next steps differ depending on if the side panel is being manned or not.

{% hint style="info" %}
Please note that you **must** play the safety spiel and it must end before you are able to dispatch.
{% endhint %}

### Main Panel Only

If only the main panel is being operated, once everyone is in, close the gates. You will now have to lower all the restraints yourself. Go row by row and click on the restraint for it to be lowered. Once that is done, go back to your panel and check that all the restraint indicators are on. Then, lock the restraints, and wait until the next block is clear. You can know that by looking at the indicator button on the panel, or one of the lights at the front of the station, which will flash when the next block is clear. When the next block is clear, you'll be able to dispatch.

### Dual Panel Operations

If both panels are being operated, it is up to the side panel operator to call when to close the gates. They will let you know by saying something like **GATES**. The next step is to lower the restraints. Typically, the main panel operator will lower the four last rows, whilst the front will lower the first four. However, if you wish to have the side panel operator lower your rows (and they dont mind), you can let them know and have them do your section. Once all restraints are locked, wait until the side panel enables the restraint lock and lock the restraints. Then wait for the side panel to dispatch enable and dispatch the train.

## Side Panel

{% hint style="warning" %}
This panel can **only** be operated when the main panel is already being manned. If it is not, please turn it off and move to the main panel.
{% endhint %}

Once everyone has passed the gates, let the main operator know to close them, by saying something like **GATES**. Now start lowering the front four restraints. The main panel operator may ask you to lower their part too. If you are ok with that let them know and proceed to lower the remaining restraints. Once they're all lowered, lock the restraints by clicking on the restraint lock button and then, once available, dispatch enable.



## Crowd Control

{% hint style="warning" %}
This position can **only** be operated when the main panel is already being manned. If it is not, you won't be able to interact with the queue control.
{% endhint %}

As shown in [panel-information.md](panel-information.md "mention") (See main panel, button 12), there is a crowd control part at the entrance of the station. Click the location to open/close an invisible wall. If closed, a chain will appear. Close the line once the station fills. When it gets emptied, wait until the gates are closed to let more people in.
