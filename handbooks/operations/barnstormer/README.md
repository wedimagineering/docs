### Incident Management

#### Guest refusing to take a seat

If this should happen, and you've repeatedly asked the guest to take a seat and they refuse, then you should try contacting a <mark style="color:blue;">**manager**</mark><mark style="color:blue;">+</mark> (if they're online), and let them know about the issue (it's also important to let them know the user's name). However, since we want to give the rest of the guests the best experience possible, you should not wait until the incident is solved to continue the normal operations and just continue and let the <mark style="color:blue;">**manager**</mark><mark style="color:blue;">+</mark> deal with it.
