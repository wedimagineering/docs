# Entertainment Rules



* Do not reset or leave the game while in character, make sure you're backstage first.

• While in a character costume never use the main chat. Only use character voice lines, and use in-game cast chat and/or Discord to talk to the character handler.&#x20;

• Never act inappropriately while in costume or as a character handler.&#x20;

• Don't do unrealistic movements and emotes while in character. Try to stick to the existing emote list.&#x20;

• Don't use admin commands when in costume, managers + only.&#x20;
