# ðŸ‘‹ Introduction

Welcome to the **WED Imagineering University Program**, a path to many different careers we provide here on Roblox.

To get started, lets review the process quickly so you can understand just what to expect on your road to become a certified ride operator.

***

#### 1. <mark style="color:blue;">Application process</mark> -> apply in the Disney Careers game

Submit your application at the Guest Relations tent in our [Hub](https://roblox.com/games/4895128840) game and wait 24-48 hours for your application status to update.

{% hint style="info" %}
The standard wait-time of application responses varies, usually between 24-48 hours but can increase beyond in case of high demand or overflow. Although we hope to be able to provide a response between that time frame if not earlier, the leadership team reserves the right to provide delay for any reason.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
Asking for your application to be reviewed or hinting towards such will result in an immediate void of your application, repeated incidents will result in a blacklist, the inability to apply. However, you reserve the right to bring forward the status of your application if it is still in pending status after a week.
{% endhint %}

If your application is <mark style="background-color:green;">accepted</mark>, you'll be automatically ranked and given access to the _"University"_ category in our discord server.

If your application is <mark style="background-color:red;">declined</mark>, we suggest improving the quality of your application or focusing on better and more detailed responses; however, we reserve the right to withhold your reason of decline.

You will be unable to apply again for 31 days until your previous application has been deleted following the monthly threshold, since the last status update.

#### 2. <mark style="color:orange;">Hands-on training</mark> -> book a training session

The members of our Leadership Team will be upfront about their training schedules, when they host large group trainings, or one-on-one / small group trainings. You should respectfully understand the commitment of these individuals and not ask or hint the request of a training.

{% hint style="info" %}
:white\_check\_mark:   I want to get trained for ###### so bad\
:x:   @######, can you host a training for ######
{% endhint %}

Please ensure your availability for **at least an hour and a half** block from the start time to attend the booked session before booking, as you're reserving a spot and preventing another available student from attending. If you don't cancel over an hour before the scheduled event begins, consequences will apply. We will not allow late entries, any late arrivals will be recognized as absences.

{% hint style="danger" %}
**1st occurrence** -> Written warning

**2nd occurrence** -> Unable to book for 14-days

**3rd occurrence** -> Termination (must submit another application)
{% endhint %}

#### 3. <mark style="color:green;">Certification completed</mark> -> receive your certification upon passing your training

Your certification is granted **upon completing and passing** your <mark style="color:orange;">Hands-on training</mark> training. Your completion of the training and passing is of rightful determination of the host/trainer with the following specified requirements:

* Two complete practical rotations through each panel (w/ supervision)
* No mistakes or questions during practical
