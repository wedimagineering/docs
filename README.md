# ðŸ‘‹ Introduction

Congratulations on moving through the [University Program](https://app.gitbook.com/o/prcTQtUAJ5c6LNUu0XEa/s/3Wf47Q6r1KBtOnr7JCv8/) and becoming certified, and remember, this is only the beginning!

Lets review some important information including cast-specific [Rules & Guidelines](rules-and-guidelines.md), [Operation handbooks](handbooks/operations/), and more that'll make your job much easier!

***

### Rules & Guidelines

We expect all Cast Members closely abide by any but not limited to set-forth rules and use of common sense while employed in the community. It is necessary that all Cast Members remain professional and create a welcoming and positive environment to improve and create magical memories for our Guests.

### Operations Handbooks

Available and at the convenience of all Cast Members, operations handbooks are heavily useful resources providing extensive ride operations guides and scripts to enhance magical memories. If at any moment should you question an operation procedure, feel free to take a look at the attraction handbook before asking for help in our community.
