# ðŸ‘‹ Introduction

Welcome to the **WED Imagineering University Program**, a path to many different careers we provide here on Roblox.

To get started, lets review the process quickly so you can understand just what to expect on your road to become certified.

***

#### 1. <mark style="color:blue;">Application process</mark> -> apply in the Disney Careers game

Submit your application in our [Disney Careers](https://www.roblox.com/games/7138323581/) game and **wait 24-48 hours** for your application status to update.

If your application is <mark style="background-color:green;">accepted</mark>, you'll be automatically ranked and given access to the _"University"_ category in our discord server.

If your application is <mark style="background-color:red;">declined</mark>, we suggest improving the quality of your application or focusing on better and more detailed responses; however, we reserve the right to withhold your reason of decline.

#### 2. <mark style="color:orange;">Hands-on training</mark> -> book a training session in our online portal

Visit our [online booking portal](https://outlook.office365.com/owa/calendar/university@wedimagineering.com/bookings/) and **select your desired certification and reserve your spot** by entering your Roblox username in the "Name" box and your email in the "Email" box (for verification purposes).&#x20;

{% hint style="warning" %}
If you feel uncomfortable sharing your email address (kept privately, used for verification and reminders) or making a temporary address, please contact the session host to be manually added.
{% endhint %}

If there are no available time slots, we suggest checking again in a day or semi-frequently to view if new openings with slots are available.

Please ensure your availability for **at least an hour and a half** block from the start time to attend the booked session before booking, as you're reserving a spot and preventing another available student from attending. If you don't cancel over an hour before the scheduled event begins, consequences will apply. We will not allow late entries, any late arrivals will be recognized as absences.

{% hint style="danger" %}
**1st occurrence** -> Written warning

**2nd occurrence** -> Unable to book for 14-days

**3rd occurrence** -> Termination (must submit another application)
{% endhint %}

#### 3. <mark style="color:green;">Certification completed</mark> -> receive your certification upon passing your training

Your certification is granted **upon completing and passing** your <mark style="color:orange;">Hands-on training</mark> training. Your completion of the training and passing is of rightful determination of the host/trainer with the following specified requirements:

* Two complete practical rotations through each panel (w/ supervision)
* No mistakes or questions during practical
