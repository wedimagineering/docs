# ðŸ“‹ Application Marking Scheme

### General Marking Principles

(a) Positive marking should be used. This means that applications should be marked by considering/assessing what the applicant has achieved, as opposed to their errors or omissions.

(b) Marks are binary; the applicant has either gained the mark or not. There are no half marks.

(c) If an error is trivial, casual, or insignificant, i.e., a misspelling which is clearly due to a typo (where the word has been used and spelt correctly elsewhere in the application), this error should be negated.

(d) Do not penalise applicants, more than once, for repeated spelling errors **within the same question**.

(e) The marking process should be fair and unbiased; don't pass or fail somebody just because they are/aren't your friend. It may be advantageous if you **do not** mark their application.

(f) All applications should be treated with the utmost confidentiality; do not share applications in a public channel.

(g) If the applicant makes a contradiction of any kind in their application, deduct **one mark**.

(f) A valid comment **must** be provided, which details why their application was declined OR contains a welcome message. Set the comment as 'Reason Withheld' for people who are blacklisted from applying.

### Points Developed to an Adequate Extent

**One mark** should be awarded for every point which is explained in adequate detail. The number of points awarded cannot exceed the total number of possible marks for the question.

### Errors in Grammar, Spelling or Punctuation

**One mark** should be deducted for **every type** of grammatical mistake. The total marks for the question cannot be less than 0.

### Considerable/Severe Errors in Question Explanations etc.

Any question with an error that is determined to be **severe** should be awarded **0 marks**.

### Offensive etc. Applications

If an application contains abuse, vulgar language etc. then it should be reported to an executive who can blacklist the person from applying.

### Calculating Scores

Applications have 28 marks; scores are scaled to 10 points. Scores should be rounded to **one significant figure**. An example of how to calculate this is shown below.

\[Example - Applicant achieved 21/28 marks]

21 âž— 28 = 0.75 OR 3/4 --> Out of **one** **mark**.

0.75 or 3/4 x 10 = 15/2 = 7.5 --> Scaled to **ten marks**.

7.5 rounded to **one significant figure** is 8, so the applicant should be awarded a score of 8.

### Maximum Marks

| Question | Maximum Marks |
| -------- | ------------- |
| 1        | 3             |
| 2        | 1             |
| 3        | 6             |
| 4        | 6             |
| 5        | 6             |
| 6        | 6             |

This means that there are 28 marks possible per application.
