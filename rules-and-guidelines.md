# ðŸš¨ Rules & Guidelines

With intention to maintain a positive and friendly environment and magical experience for all guests, we have a few additional rules specific to Cast Members to help better ensure transparency and understanding.

{% hint style="warning" %}
All cast members are **expected to abide by the following cast-specific rules** at all times when present at an attraction and performing cast-related tasks such as operations.
{% endhint %}

#### Community-based rules

1. Cast Members may not use their special access to cast-related channels in the community ("Discord") category to provide others outside of the role with employee announcements, photos, documents, or messages.
2. Cast Members may not misrepresent their employment, reputation of the company, or be of involvement with any defamation of the company.
   1. This includes but isn't limited to; arguing with guests, violating terms of services of our community or platforms ("Discord server", "Discord", "Roblox"), arguing with other Cast Members, or arguing against/about company directives.
3. Cast Members may not request or hint regarding the desire or deservingness of a promotion on behalf of either themselves or another Cast Member.
4. Members of the leadership team withhold the ability to responsibly moderate any incident or situation and apply any consequences to situations they find necessary.

#### Attraction-based rules

4. Cast Members may not leave a panel powered-on while or after operating an attraction and not being present, as if left unattended, guests will be incapable of experiencing the attraction.
   1. Upon disconnection, you must return immediately and continue or power-off the panel.
5. Cast Members may not operate multiple panels at an attraction at the same time, this includes having two panels powered-on and completing actions on both panels.
6. Cast Members may not wear unrealistic clothing while operating an attraction, this includes but is not limited to bulky clothing, large accessories, unrealistic distractions, or masks/hats that fully cover your face.
7. Cast Members must wear their uniform and nametag (top-right menus in-game), while clocked-in and actively representing the company as an employee.
8. Active operators or others may not complete operation actions on panels they are not presently operating while clocked-in. This includes restrictive use of panels being operated by other users, only if immediately necessary.
   1. Cast Members may not argue regarding the operator status of a panel or their duration of operation. Cast Members should use reasonable judgement and provide reasonable rotation and allow other involvement if present.
   2. Any attempts to exploit the clock/shift system in attempt to get points, including idling, or AFK-farming will result in immediate termination, employment blacklisting, and data wipe.
9. Cast Members should use grammar at all times while clocked in (not limited to interactions with guests), this includes professional communications, professional attitude, and complete sentences.
